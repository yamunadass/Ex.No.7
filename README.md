## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT to demonstrate how to create a prompt-based system for organizing daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

---

## AI Tools Required
- ChatGPT (Large Language Model by OpenAI)  
- Optional: Google Colab / Python Command Line Interface for simulation  
- Internet access for prompt experimentation  

---

## Explanation
This experiment aims to develop a **personal productivity assistant** that interacts naturally with users to manage daily activities. The assistant uses **prompt engineering techniques** to perform tasks such as organizing to-do lists, scheduling events, giving wellness suggestions, and answering general queries.

Through effective prompt design, the model can simulate memory, adapt to user preferences, and respond contextually. This project showcases how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be leveraged for creative and practical problem-solving applications.

## Prompt Used
> **Prompt:**  
> "Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

---

## Procedure

1. **Define Requirements**
   - The system should manage daily tasks and reminders.  
   - It should provide personalized wellness tips.  
   - It should respond naturally to user inputs.  
   - It should simulate adaptability based on user interaction.  

2. **Construct Prompts for Each Task**
   - **Task Manager:**  
     `"Remind me to complete my assignment by 6 PM."`  
   - **Scheduler:**  
     `"Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 10 AM with my project team."`  
   - **Wellness Tips:**  
     `"Give me a health tip for today."`  
   - **General Query:**  
     `"What’s the best way to stay productive while studying?"`  

3. **Simulate Interaction**
   - Run prompts in ChatGPT or a Python-based CLI.  
   - Observe how ChatGPT handles task addition, updates, and reminders.  
   - Record generated outputs.  

4. **Collect Feedback**
   - Ask the user how helpful the assistant was.  
   - Modify prompts to improve contextual understanding.  

5. *(Optional)* **Integrate Memory Simulation**
   - Store previous preferences or feedback in a simple list or file.  
   - Adjust prompts accordingly to personalize responses.

## Expected Output

### Personal Productivity Assistant Features

**1. Daily Task Manager:**  
- Accepts tasks via natural language (e.g., “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM”).  
- Organizes tasks by priority and deadline.  
- Provides daily summaries and pending items.  

**2. Smart Scheduler:**  
- Schedules events and sets reminders using contextual understanding.  
- Notifies users of overlapping appointments or free time slots.  

**3. Wellness Tips Generator:**  
- Suggests daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).  
- Adapts suggestions based on past user preferences.  

**4. General Query Support:**  
- Answers everyday questions related to study, productivity, and well-being.
